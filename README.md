Phonetic transcription and prosody analysis are essential tools in the study of speech, facilitating accurate representation of both speech sound  and the suprasegmental features that shape meaning and emotion in spoken language. Phonetic transcription systems like the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) offer a standardized method for documenting the precise articulation of speech across languages.
Prosody analysis, on the other hand, captures elements such as intonation, stress, rhythm, and timing, which are crucial for conveying pragmatic information and speaker intent. Integrating these prosodic features into phonetic transcription enhances our understanding of language patterns, enriching fields such as linguistics, speech technology, and language education.
This report explores the role of prosody in communication, reviews transcription systems that incorporate prosodic elements, and examines the challenges and benefits of combining phonetic and prosodic transcription. The integration of prosody with phonetic transcription offers significant value in speech recognition technology, clinical speech pathology, and language teaching by providing a more holistic approach to the analysis of spoken language.
By offering, web-based platforms can leverage combined phonetic and prosodic transcriptions to create more accurate speech recognition systems, advanced language learning tools, and improved diagnostic methods in speech therapy. The integration of prosody into digital transcription provides a holistic understanding of speech, improving communication tools and applications in various fields.
